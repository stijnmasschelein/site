When division managers are evaluated using a competitive performance evaluation scheme, a supportive leadership tone leads to a higher likelihood that divisions will settle on a transfer price close to the equal-profit transfer price. In contrast, when division managers are evaluated using a cooperative performance evaluation scheme, leadership tone does not significantly affect the likelihood that divisions settle on an equal-profit transfer price. These results demonstrate that firms, maintaining individual performance evaluations in a decentralized company structure, can use an informal control such as leadership tone to manage negotiation conflicts.","tags":["Management Accounting","Fairness","Leadership"],"title":"The effect of performance evaluation schemes on predicted transfer prices: Do leadership tone and perceived fairness concerns matter?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["econometrics"],"content":" In our weekly seminar, Robert Faff presented a paper with an OLS model with the quadratic and cubic term effects. The dependent variable in this model is the change in cash holdings (\\(\\Delta CH\\)) by a company and the independent variable is the deviation of current cash holding from the optimal level (\\(\\Delta OPT\\)). The paper argues that there are three different regimes of adjustment speed of cash holdings. Very high cash holdings will lead to the largest adjustment back to the optimal level, very low cash holdings will lead to a large but smaller adjustment towards the optimal level, the medium level of cash holdings leads to the smallest (or no) adjustment. This is the motivation to use a cubic model.\nThe relevant part of the OLS model is\n\\[ \\Delta CH_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\Delta OPT_i + \\beta_2 \\Delta OPT_i^2 + \\beta_3 \\Delta OPT_i^3 + \\epsilon_i \\]\nThe results show that \\(\\beta_0 = -0.0038\\), \\(\\beta_1=0.2633\\), \\(\\beta_2=-0.0790\\), and \\(\\beta_3=0.3827\\). The problem is that those coefficients alone do not necessarily tells us anything about the three regimes and the speed of cash holding adjustment. Typically we are interested in the marginal effect of a variable. In this case the speed of adjustment which you can see as\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial \\Delta CH}{\\partial \\Delta OPT} = \\beta_1 + 2 \\beta_2 \\Delta OPT + 3\\beta_3 \\Delta OPT^2 \\]\nYou can see that the speed of adjustment depends on three coefficients and the value of \\(\\Delta OPT\\). One way to represent the effect of \\(\\Delta OPT\\) on \\(\\Delta CH\\) is to give the effect for different levels of \\(\\Delta OPT\\) and that is what the paper does. Another way of doing that is to make a plot. I quickly show how you can do that in R.\nFirst of all, I have to make a couple of assumptions because I don’t have the full data. From the descriptive statistics, we know the meand (mopt) and (sdopt) for \\(\\Delta OPT\\). From those we can generate the distribution of deviations. I tried two options: a normal distribution (opt_dev_norm) and a t-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (opt_dev_t). The latter will give us larger outliers. Than we just calculate the cash holding change based on the ’s above and the OLS specification. Finally, you can plot the relation between change in cash holding and the deviation from the optimal level.\nWhat struck me was that the three regimes are much more clear with the t-distribution than with the normal distribution for the deviations. In other words, it looks like the extreme cases are doing a lot of work to identify the regimes.\nrequire(ggplot2) ## Loading required package: ggplot2 mopt = -0.0026 sdopt = 0.1488 opt_dev_norm = rnorm(1e4, mopt, sdopt) opt_dev_t = rt(1e4, df = 3) * sqrt(sdopt^2/3) + mopt round(quantile(opt_dev_norm, probs = c(0.75, 0.5, 0.25)), 2) ## 75% 50% 25% ## 0.1 0.0 -0.1 round(quantile(opt_dev_t, probs = c(0.75, 0.5, 0.25)), 2) ## 75% 50% 25% ## 0.06 0.00 -0.07 cash_change_norm = -0.0038 + 0.2633 * opt_dev_norm - 0.0790 * opt_dev_norm ^ 2 + 0.3827 * opt_dev_norm ^ 3 normplot = qplot(x = opt_dev_norm, y = cash_change_norm) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Normal distributed deviations\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() cash_change_t = -0.0038 + 0.2633 * opt_dev_t - 0.0790 * opt_dev_t ^ 2 + 0.3827 * opt_dev_t ^ 3 tplot = qplot(x = opt_dev_t, y = cash_change_t) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;T distributed deviations\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() print(normplot) print(tplot) ","date":1521072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521072000,"objectID":"fc640d74d49b9902b07aed38708fe745","permalink":"/post/quadratic-and-cubic-terms-in-linear-models/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/quadratic-and-cubic-terms-in-linear-models/","section":"post","summary":"In our weekly seminar, Robert Faff presented a paper with an OLS model with the quadratic and cubic term effects.

He describes the trap of trying to explain complex social science problems with ever more complex theories. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to the tendency of asking the seminar question: \u0026ldquo;Have you thought about all these other factors that also might play a role?\u0026rdquo; 1. I see it a lot and when my undergraduates, honours and Phd students try to improve on a theory. They just try to add more bells and whistles. I guess in some of the accounting literature it shows up as tesing for more and more variables that explain earnings management or that moderate the effect of incentives on performance.\nHealy gives three reasons why too much nuance in a theory is possibe and should be avoided.\n  If theories can be ever more expanded upon by making them more nuanced it becomes more difficult to refute them. In that sense, Agency Theory is not really a theory. You can always come up with a new Agency Theory model that fits your data. A single Agency Theory model can be seen as a theory and can be refuted by data. A good theory does not need to be adapted for each new application.\n  Less nuance can be interesting. Healy explains that the interestingness of a theory is not just an attribute of a theory, it also depends on who is communicating and who is the audience. In a literature full of nuanced theories, where every effect depends on country specific institutions, a simple theory that holds universally is interesting.\n  There are also strategic reasons to not care too much about nuanced theories. Simpeler theories are easier to communicate and understand. They can spread easier.\n    Which is a different question from \u0026ldquo;Is it possible that your effect is driven by this other explanation?\u0026rdquo;. This is basically saying you need a different theory not make your theory more complicated.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1520035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520035200,"objectID":"7a57319a7160bfcba6d3a0c815940e7e","permalink":"/post/on-nuance/","publishdate":"2018-03-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/on-nuance/","section":"post","summary":"Keeping in theme with the swearing, another paper I would like to present is \u0026ldquo;Fuck Nuance\u0026rdquo; by Kieran Healy, a sociology professor.

A good summary is found at the Metrics Monday blog.\nThe take-a-way message is that clustering is not an empirical issue but a research design decisions.\n Moreover, we show that the question whether, and at what level, to adjust standard errors for clustering is a substantive question that cannot be informed solely by the data (Abadie et al.)\n What that means is that it is not enough to run the analysis with and without clustered standard errors and check whether there is any difference.\nThere are two things two consider:\n  Sampling: If you randomly sample a subset of the clusters in the population and leave some out. A research design like that is not uncommon with hand collected data where the hand collected data is only collected for a subset of firms in the ASX200 but for multiple time periods. In this case, you should cluster at the firm level if you want to say something about the ASX200 firms that are not in your dataset. This is probably the less important issue for most accounting and finance studies.\n  Causal effect: If you have a causal effect (e.g. a change in regulation), and that is administered to a cluster and not to individual observations, you should cluster at that level. For instance, if you do a study with US data, and you look at a regulatory change in some states but not in other states, you should cluster at the state level. Similar for cross-country studies.\n  PS: Adding fixed effects only absolves you of clustering standard errors if you think that your causal effect is the same for each observation. That is if you think that some firms will react differently to a change in regulation, fixed effects don\u0026rsquo;t solve the need for clustering.\nInstrumental variables. The second one by Young focuses on (weak) instrumental variables and their standard errors. It does not look very good for the traditional 2SLS estimators.\nThe paper uses the bootstrap to test whether the standard errors of 2SLS are appropriate. They are not. 2SLS underestimates the standard errors and leads to more false positives. You should use the bootstrap to estimate standard errors of 2SLS. The intuition is that least squared standard errors are not very robust to deviations from normally distributed residuals. The two equations in 2SLS multiply the bias in standard errors compared to the one equation in OLS.\nThe paper actually show that in a lot of cases, you are better of to use regular OLS than 2SLS with bootstrap. Long story short, if you want to use 2SLS you have to have a setting that resembles a natural experiment.\nResiduals as dependent variables The last one by Chen, Hribar, and Melessa is especially relevant for the accountants. The link is to the working paper. The paper has been accepted in JAR. The paper deals with research designs where in a first step, a researcher runs a regression to measure the unexpected component of a variable (e.g. abnormal returns, unexpected audit fees, unexpected earnings) and then in a second step the researcher runs a regression on the unexpected component.\nThe basic problem is that if the independent variables from step 1 are not included in step 2, you get biased estimates. The results suggests that there are some false positives in the literature. The solution is relatively simple\n Do not run two different regressions but run one regression with all independent variables from step 1 and step 2. If that is not possible, you can run 2 regressions but you have to use all independent variables from step 1 in step 2 regression.

Heightened trait anxiety is associated with biases in both these processes: high trait-anxious individuals tend to report heightened risk perceptions, and inappropriate engagement in danger mitigation behavior. However, no research has addressed whether the calibration between risk perception and danger mitigation behavior is affected by anxiety, though it is well recognized that this calibration is crucial for adaptive functioning. The current study aimed to examine whether anxiety is characterized by better or worse calibration of danger mitigation behavior to variations in risk magnitude. Low and high trait-anxious participants were presented with information about the likelihood and severity of a danger (loud noise burst) on each trial. Participants could decide to mitigate this danger by investing a virtual coin, at the cost of losing danger mitigation ability on subsequent trials. Importantly, level of risk likelihood and severity were varied independently, and the multiplicative relationship between the 2 defined total danger. Multilevel modeling showed that the magnitude of total danger predicted the probability of coin investments, over and above the effects of risk likelihood and severity, suggesting that participants calibrated their danger mitigation behavior to integrated risk information. Crucially, this calibration was affected by trait anxiety, indicating better calibration in high trait-anxious individuals. These results are discussed in light of existing knowledge and models of the effect of anxiety on risk perception and decision-making.","tags":["Anxiety","Risk","Bayesian Estimation","Stan"],"title":"To risk or not to risk: Anxiety and the calibration between risk perception and danger mitigation.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tony Simons","Hannes Leroy","Veroniek Collewaert","Stijn Masschelein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409961600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409961600,"objectID":"a31514aea7a16cb66bea27310719fff9","permalink":"/publication/jbe2015/","publishdate":"2014-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jbe2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Substantial research examines the follower consequences of leader (mis)alignment of words and deeds, but no research has quantitatively reviewed these effects. This study examines extant research on behavioral integrity (BI) and contrasts it with two other constructs that focus on (mis)alignment: moral integrity and psychological contract breaches. We compare effect sizes between the three constructs, and find that BI has stronger effects on trust, in-role task performance and citizenship behavior (OCB) than moral integrity and stronger effects on commitment and OCB than psychological contract breach. These stronger attitudinal consequences run counter to our initial expectations, but they provide evidence of important conceptual distinctions and mechanisms that we articulate. BI theory suggests that BI’s greater performance impact is due to the notion that BI affects communication clarity in addition to attitudes. Results of meta-analytic structural equation modeling are consistent with this proposed dual path of BI’s impact. We highlight avenues for future research on BI and discuss how our findings inform the broader research on leader (mis)alignment.","tags":["Leadership","Integrity","Meta Analysis"],"title":"How Leader Alignment of Words and Deeds Affects Followers: A Meta-analysis of Behavioral Integrity Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stijn Masschelein","Eddy Cardinaels","Alexandra Van den Abbeele"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"2cf81e1d6abb0fa68791d0a25d85e672","permalink":"/publication/tar2012/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tar2012/","section":"publication","summary":"We examine the effect of more precise cost information on contract renegotiations between supply-chain parties. Specifically, we experimentally investigate the benefits of activity-based costing (ABC) information to address common supply-chain inefficiencies that are caused by the buyer or the seller, but have the same underlying costs. Results suggest that the impact of more precise cost information depends crucially on the cause of the inefficiency that parties need to address during the negotiation. ABC information increases the total joint profit in the supply chain. However, ABC information increases the seller's perceptions of the fairness of the buyer's arguments for contract changes only when the buyer causes the inefficiency but not when the seller causes the inefficiency. The combined effect of ABC information on joint profit and fairness perceptions thus increases the buyer's profit only when buyer causes the inefficiency but not when the seller causes the inefficiency.Data Availability: Data are available from the first author upon request.","tags":["Management Accounting","Fairness","Cost Accounting","Negotiation"],"title":"ABC Information, Fairness Perceptions, and Interfirm Negotiations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":":e:ew\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"dfda379b39ffa47c4b3efc6b2b69e095","permalink":"/post/2020-06-05-theorising/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-06-05-theorising/","section":"post","summary":":e:ew","tags":null,"title":"","type":"post"}]

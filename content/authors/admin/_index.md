bio: "I am a lecturer in accounting at the University of Western
Australia. I am interested in the role of (management accounting)
information in decision making and risk taking. My research
investigate how verifiable and subjective information supports formal
and informal contracts. My interest is easily piqued and as a result I
am involved in a wide variety of projects such as field applications
in target setting and cost of quality, lab experiments on
negotiations, markets, and risk taking, survey research on integrity and quantitative field studies in the banking sector. I developed experience in a
range of statistical methods such as meta-analysis, (Bayesian)
multilevel models, and simulations."

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "In recent years, management accounting researchers have become aware that management choices do not happen in a vacuum. Managers change incentives, decision making power, and information systems taking into account the systems that a firm is already using. The implications for quantitative analysis are only starting to be understood. This project uses simulations studies to investigate the robustness of current methods and proposes new methods consistent with new theories."
